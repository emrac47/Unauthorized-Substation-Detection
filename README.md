# Unauthorized-Substation-Detection
# In this project, the spectral band parameters, which correpond to unauthorised and authorised substations has been extracted from the Landsat-8 OLI images.
# The obtained parameters were then saved as "sasondata.mat" on matlab.
# In the last stage, automatic recognition of unauthorised substations has been performed by utilizing the Ensembling Logit-Boost Algorithm "Ensemble_Sason.m".
# For any question, please write to "emrullah.acar@batman.edu.tr".
